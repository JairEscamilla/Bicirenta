# Final Proyect: "Bicycle Rental System"
This project was done at the subject Programming Fundamentals at Universidad Iberoamericana.
The project tries to simulate the ecobici's system that is being implemented in Mexico City.

## Compilation
You need to open the terminal and write:
```bash
$gcc bicirenta.c -o bicirenta.exe
```

## Usage
You can run the program in 3 ways. You can see the users registrations with the command:
```bash
$./bicirenta.exe -usu
```
You can see the help menu with the command:
```bash
$./bicirenta.exe -h
```
You can see the developers credits with the command:
```bash
$./bicirenta.exe -c
```
If you don't introduce any parameters to the program from the terminal, you can login into the system. Example:
```bash
$./bicirenta.exe
```
